# 9 Rights for the new workplace

- We believe that an an organization should respect and develop the humanity of it's employees and assosciates. 
- We believe that. In an age where automation and A.I. threaten jobs and livelihoods across the globe, organizations must evolve to honour that which makes humans more than machines.
- We believe that this does not simply make for better lives, businesses that respect these rights will proove to be better able to adapt and thrive in the coming age. 

*We believe that evey worker has the right to expect the following:* 

## 1. The right to clear direction
**You have the right to know how to best apply your energy in a manner that will be respected and valued.**

Time is the most valuable thing any of posess. Any organization that asks us to use our time in their service must show their respect by not wasting this resource, and ensuring that, we have a clear understanding of how we are able to direct our energy. 

## 2. The right to support
**Every individual working for an organization has the right to expect to work within a context that provides what they need to contribute their creativity** 

To work well, we need to trust that we are being looked after. We must be paid a fair wage, given enough time, provided with tools and an environment that is conducive to us achieving our goals. 

## 3. The right to evolve
**Your work should evolve over time, adapting to changes and stimulating you to learn new things** 

To be treated as humans rather than machines, and to ensure that, over time, our work remains relevant, we have the right to expect that what we do will continue to evolve. As the context within which we work changes, so must the work we do. Our organizations must have the capacity to change with the times. 

## 4. The right to effective process
**The appropriate processes must be in place to ensure that your work is compatible with that of your colleagues**

To know that our work is not wasted, we need to know how to coordinate with others, how to produce in a form that is useful to others and know who has authority to get things done. It must be clear how decisions get made, who needs to make them, and the organization will adapt when new, uncertain, situations arise. 

## 5. The right to be honest
**You have the right to tell the truth and to learn your mistakes without fear of negative consequences.**

The truth must ttump seniority at every level. An organization must have respect for and a pursuit of honesty, expending energy to develop its organizational and human capacity to face the truth and to listen to feedback.

## 6. The right to feel
**You have the right to expres your emotions and to have your emotional health respected, valued and promoted.**

## 7. The right to uncertainty
**You have the right to be trusted to navigate the unknown.** 

We should all expect our organizations to be able to navigate uncertain and unknown environments. No business has the luxury to expect that the way it worked yesterday will still be valid tomorrow, and as a result it must put in place systems and processes to cope wioth uncertainty, trusting it's team to use their best judgement, and providing feedback to help them navigate. 
## 8. The right to develop as a human
You are aided in your journey to develop your whole self in order to achieve your fullest potential
## 9. The right to meaningful work
The work you do has meaning, and connects with your personal sense of purpose.
