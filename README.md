# 9 Rights for the new workplace

- We believe that an an organization should respect and develop the humanity of it's employees and associates. 
- We believe that, in an age where automation and A.I. threaten jobs and livelihoods across the globe, organizations must evolve to honour that which makes humans more than machines.
- We believe that this does not simply make for better lives, businesses that respect these rights will prove to be better able to adapt and thrive in the coming age. 

*We believe that every worker has the right to expect the following:* 

// I feel that '1. The right to direction' is implicit in some of the later points, though maybe the idea of 'time as a resource' could be echoed somewhere

## 1. The right to innovate without competition
**The organization you work with should encourage you to innovate beacuse innovation is cool, not beacuse you are in internal competition with your co-workers**

## 2. The right to get things done
**The organization you work with must provide you with what you need to get things done**  

We must be paid a fair wage, given enough time to deliver, not be handed clearly impossible tasks or goals and be provided with adequate tools and working conditions in order to do our work.

## 3. The right to relevance
**You have the right to expect that your work is relevant, and will evolve as the environment within which it is applies changes**

There are possibly very few jobs left on the planet that are not impacted by the rapid march of change. We should all expect that the organizations we work for are able to sense when they need to change, and are capable of altering what they produce and the way in which they operate to ensure that our work remains relevant. 

## 4. The right to proficient productivity
**You have the right work in an environment that has the appropriate processes and policies in place to create sustainable productivity.**

The organizations we work with must be... organized. To produce relevant, useful and valued work, we must trust that our employers are effective at creating environments where our time is not wasted and our work is not undermined by inefficiency, politics, bias or corruption. 
It must be clear how decisions get made, who needs to make them, and how the organization will adapt when new, uncertain, situations arise. 

## 5. The right to honesty
**You have the right to tell your truth, to expect the same of others, and to know that honesty is not penalised**

The truth must trump seniority at every level. An organization must have respect for and a pursuit of honesty, expending energy to develop its organizational and human capacity to face the truth, to listen to feedback and avoid scapegoating.

## 6. The right to trust
**You have the right to expect levels of trust between you and those you work with to grow over time.***

To do our best work, we must trust those we work with and they need to trust us. This trust must be given the space to grow and be nurtured into existence - and you have the right to expect that the organizations you work will support and facilitate that growth.

## 7. The right to fail
**You have the right to be supported and trusted to navigate the unknown.** 

In order to navigate changing or unknown environments, organizations, and those that work with them, must know how to fail well. No business has the luxury to expect that the way it worked yesterday will still be valid tomorrow, and as a result it must put in place systems and processes to cope with uncertainty, trusting it's team to use their best judgement, and providing feedback to help them navigate.

## 8. The right to humane growth
**You have the right to grow in your own direction and to expect support and encouragment for your growth.**

When we are able to be ourselves, and to become even better at being ourselves, we can achieve so much more. We should expect that those we work with will invest in our capacity to be more - because it allows us to provide even better value over time.  

## 9. The right to meaning
**You have the right to a job that is meaningful to you and connects with your personal sense of purpose**

When the work we do matters, it is just better. We should expect that the organizations we work with will use the energy we invest and apply it to achieve something worth doing.
