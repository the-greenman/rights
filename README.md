# 9 Rights for the new workplace

- We believe that an an organization should respect and develop the humanity of it's employees and assosciates. 
- We believe that. In an age where automation and A.I. threaten jobs and livelihoods across the globe, organizations must evolve to honour that which makes humans more than machines.
- We believe that this does not simply make for better lives, businesses that respect these rights will proove to be better able to adapt and thrive in the coming age. 

*We believe that evey worker has the right to expect the following:* 

## 1. The right to clear direction
**You have the right to know how to best apply your energy in a manner that will be respected and valued.**

Time is the most valuable thing any of us posess. Any organization that asks us to use our time in their service must show their respect by not wasting this resource, and ensuring that, we have a clear understanding of how we are able to direct our energy. 

## 2. The right to get things done
**The organization you work with must provide a context that supports your work, and puts it to good use without unnecessary waste .**  

We all have the right to expect an organization to be competent at doing what it does, and that it will support our individual contributions to the best of it's abilities. We must be paid a fair wage, given enough time, provided with tools and an environment that is conducive to us achieving our goals. 

## 3. The right to be relevant
**You have the right to expect that your work is relevant, and will evolve as the environment within which it is applies changes**

There are possibly very few jobs left on the planet that are not impacted by the rapid march change. We should all expect that the organizations we work for are able to sense when they need to change, and are capable of altering what they produce and the way in which they operate to ensure that our work remains relevant. 

## 4. The right to good governance
**You have the right work in an environment that has the appropriate procesess and policies in place to create a stable, productive environment.**

The organizations we work with must be... organized. To produce relevant, useful and valued work, we must trust that our employers are effective at creating environments where our time is not wasted, nor our work undermined by inefficiency, politics, bias or corruption. 
It must be clear how decisions get made, who needs to make them, and the organization will adapt when new, uncertain, situations arise. 

## 5. The right to honesty
**You have the right to tell your truth, to expect the same of others, and to know that honesty is not penalised**

The truth must trump seniority at every level. An organization must have respect for and a pursuit of honesty, expending energy to develop its organizational and human capacity to face the truth and to listen to feedback.

## 6. The right to trust and be trusted
**You have the right to know that the level of trust between you and those you work with will grow over time.***

To do our best work, we must trust that those we work with, and they need to trust us. This kind of connection must be given the space to grow and be nurtured into existence - and you have the right to expect that the organizations you work with are doing what is needed.

## 7. The right to fail
**You have the right to be supported and trusted to navigate the unknown.** 

In order to navigate unknown and uncertain environments, organizations, and those that work with them, must know how to fail well. No business has the luxury to expect that the way it worked yesterday will still be valid tomorrow, and as a result it must put in place systems and processes to cope with uncertainty, trusting it's team to use their best judgement, and providing feedback to help them navigate.

## 8. The right to develop as a human
**You have the right to grow as an individual, and for your work to support and encorage your growth.**

We should all be are aided in your journey to develop your whole self in order to achieve your fullest potential

## 9. The right to meaningful work
The work you do has meaning, and connects with your personal sense of purpose.
